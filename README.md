# Machine Learning Based on the Use Case Energy Prediction
we want to show the implementation of a supervised learning procedure with the necessary pre- and post-processing steps using the use case of the energy prediction of a machining process.
Our goal is to perform a regression analysis using the data that we have to train different regression models to predict the target variable. 
In our use case we want to predict the energy requirement to perform a milling process.
